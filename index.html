          <p>Based on findings, we can conclude that Powerhouse countries all
          have similar traits. 
          
          All the powerhouse countries we have looked into have
          around the same player average height. Which is quite invaluable in this sport,
          even though feet are the main tools to play. This is because taller people
          are generally stronger, faster (longer strides) and are at an advantage when 
          the header skill is utilised.

      <div class="pure-u-1-2">
        <div>
          <p>
            Top countries also seem to have the same ratio of right-left dominant feet
            whilst also kicking around the same amount of goals in a calendar year.

            On top of that, the player's average metrics are nearly the same that it could 
            almost be mistaken for being identical.

        <p  style="text-align: center;">In this visualisation, we will be choosing a handful of teams <br>
          that have won the World Cup, as we will be assuming that a <br>
          "World Class" team has won at least one football/soccer's <br>
          prestigious achievement.

          <p>When hovering over the red dots below, we can see <br>
            that each of the marked countries' average player height <br>
            exceeds more than 180.

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Whilst this there is a relationship between the marked countries <br>
            and the player's average height. It is also true that other countries' <br>
            height are also at the same range. But are considered a significantly <br>
            weaker footballing nation. Like Australia <br>

            Something that can be noticed straight away is
            each countries goal tally dips during the same year.
            Whilst we cannot definitively say what it is, we can
            assume that its not because these teams all of a sudden
            became bad.

          <h2>Left footed player statistics</h2>
          <p>
            We look at the statistics of left footed players
            because it is not an unknown fact that they are much harder to play
            against. As many are used to playing against right footed players.
            <br><br>
            But looking at the visualisation on the left. We could conclude that
            the ratio of left-right footed players are about the same.

          <p>Viewing and interacting with the pie chart next to us.
            It looks like every country has around the same slice of pie
            for every player metric.

            Seeing that every country's slice of pie is divided evenly may be the
            reason why they are a top footballing nation. They are simply balanced
            in every category.
